## Control pages

Control pages from each subsystem serve to provide an interface to change
settings, start measurements, or read out values of devices used in that
subsystem.  Each control page is defined separately for each
subsystem/database.  For more information on how to construct control pages,
see the [tutorial]{@tutorial build_control}.  

Shown is the control site for the digitizers site:
